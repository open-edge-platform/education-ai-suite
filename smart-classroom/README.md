# 🎓 Smart Classroom
The Smart Classroom project is a modular, extensible framework designed to process and summarize educational content using advanced AI models. It supports transcription, summarization, and future capabilities like video understanding and real-time analysis. 

## This project provides: 

### 🔊 Audio file processing and transcription (e.g., Whisper, Paraformer) 
### 🧠 Summarization using powerful LLMs (e.g., Qwen, LLaMA) 
### 📦 Plug-and-play architecture for integrating new ASR and LLM models 
### ⚙️ API-first design ready for frontend integration 
### 🛠️ Ready-to-extend for real-time streaming, diarization, translation, and video analysis 
The goal is to transform raw classroom recordings into concise, structured summaries for students, educators, and learning platforms.
