# Get Started on Linux

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Feature availability disclaimer:** The Linux version of Smart Classroom is still under development. In addition to ASR, summaries, mind maps and video analytics, the Linux app packages topic segmentation and Content Search (including RAG Q&A). Do not assume that other Windows features or all Windows workflows are supported on Linux.

This guide walks you through cloning the repository, configuring defaults, and running the application on Linux using the `setup.sh` script.

## Step 1: Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed. See [System Requirements](./system-requirements.md) for details.

- Docker Engine and the Docker Compose plugin (your user must be able to run `docker` without `sudo`)
- Git
- Python 3 (`python3`) with `pyyaml` available (used by `setup.sh` helper scripts)
- An Intel GPU and its Linux driver, available at `/dev/dri`. The Content Search reranker requires GPU access; `setup.sh` stops with an error if the GPU device or host `render` group is missing.

> [!NOTE]
> Node.js for the UI build is provisioned by `setup.sh` through `scripts/node-setup.sh`.

## Step 2: Clone Repository

Go to the target directory of your choice and clone the suite.
If you want to clone a specific release branch, replace `main` with the desired tag.
To learn more about partial cloning, see the [Repository Cloning guide](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/OEP-articles/contribution-guide.html#repository-cloning-partial-cloning).

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --branch main https://github.com/open-edge-platform/education-ai-suite.git
cd education-ai-suite/smart-classroom/Linux
```

## Step 3: Configuration

### A. Enable Feature Configuration

Features are enabled or disabled through the `features:` block in `config.yaml`. Only enabled features are initialized at startup. `setup.sh` derives `COMPOSE_PROFILES` in `.env` from this block.

```yaml
features:
  asr:                { enabled: true }   # Speech-to-text transcription
  summary:            { enabled: true }   # AI class summary / report
  mindmap:            { enabled: true }   # Mind map generation
  topic_segmentation: { enabled: true }   # Timestamped topics and topic search
  content_search:     { enabled: true }   # Multimodal uploads and semantic search
  qa:                 { enabled: true }   # RAG Q&A over indexed materials
  video_analytics:    { enabled: true }   # Video analytics
```

Topic segmentation automatically enables ASR and Content Search. Q&A also
automatically enables Content Search. Search services run inside the app container,
with their internal ports bound to localhost; access them through the app proxy on
port 8000, not through a host port 9011. Both the packaged UI and Vite development
UI use this proxy.

The first search-enabled start downloads/exports CLIP, the document embedding
model and the reranker. The Content Search reranker always runs on GPU;
document embeddings may run on CPU, and the main text-generation model can run
on GPU through OVMS. The app image includes the Intel OpenCL/Level Zero runtime,
and Docker passes through `/dev/dri` with the host `render` group permission.
The Hugging Face cache and converted models persist in
the model-cache volume. ChromaDB, SQLite metadata and uploaded files persist in
`storage/content-search/` (or under `STORAGE_DIR` when overridden). Do not remove
that directory when recreating the app container.

### B. Default Configuration

Models are set in `config.yaml`. Changing `models.text_gen.vlm_name`, the embedding model, or the content search reranker is picked up by `setup.sh`, which syncs `components/vlm/config/startup-models.yaml` and `startup-models.gpu.yaml`.

```yaml
asr:
  provider: openai            # Supported: openvino, openai, funasr
  name: whisper-small
  device: CPU

text_gen:
  provider: vlm
  vlm_name: Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct
  device: GPU                 # Options: GPU or CPU
  weight_format: int4         # Supported: fp16, int4, int8
  max_new_tokens: 5120
```

### C. Hugging Face Token (Optional)

Speaker diarization (pyannote) and gated models need a Hugging Face token. Request access to the [Pyannote Speaker Diarization Community v1](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1) model, create a Read token at [Hugging Face Access Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), then:

1. Set `diarization: true` under `models.asr` in `config.yaml`.
2. Add the token to `.env`:

```bash
HF_TOKEN=hf_your_access_token_here
```

> [!NOTE]
> `setup.sh` creates `.env` from `.env.example` on first run. If you want to set `HF_TOKEN` beforehand, run `cp .env.example .env` first. `setup.sh` warns when diarization is enabled and `HF_TOKEN` is missing.

Setup pulls `intel/audio-analyzer` whenever the audio-analyzer service is started.
For an optional manual local build, see
[Linux: Manual Docker Startup](../advanced-setup-guide.md#linux-manual-docker-startup).

## Step 4: Run the Setup Script

From the `Linux` directory, run:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The script performs the following:

1. Initializes the `edge-ai-libraries` (sparse checkout) and `performance-tools` git submodules.
2. Installs and verifies the Node.js toolchain for the UI.
3. Creates `.env` from `.env.example` if it does not exist.
4. Warns if diarization is enabled without `HF_TOKEN`.
5. Syncs `startup-models.yaml` and `startup-models.gpu.yaml` with `config.yaml`.
6. Derives `COMPOSE_PROFILES` from the enabled features.
7. Requires an Intel GPU (`/dev/dri`), sets `RENDER_GID` from the host's `render` group, and enables the GPU Compose configuration.
8. Validates the compose config, pulls `intel/audio-analyzer`, builds the
   remaining locally configured images, then starts the stack.
9. Waits for the `smart-classroom-app` container to become healthy and, when search
   features are enabled, for Content Search aggregate readiness. Setup exits with
   an error rather than reporting success if either readiness check times out.
10. Runs `npm install` and starts the UI dev server in the background.

> [!NOTE]
> First-time execution can take a long time (up to about 30 minutes) while models are downloaded and exported. Override the wait time with `HEALTH_TIMEOUT_S`, for example `HEALTH_TIMEOUT_S=3600 ./setup.sh`.

> [!NOTE]
> For manual Docker startup instead of `./setup.sh`, including how to set
> `RENDER_GID` and run the Compose commands, see
> [Linux: Manual Docker Startup](../advanced-setup-guide.md#linux-manual-docker-startup)
> in the Advanced Setup Guide.

On success you should see:

```text
[setup] ✅ App is healthy: http://localhost:8000/
[setup] ✅ UI: http://localhost:5173/  (logs: .../ui/vite-dev.log)
[setup] ✅ setup complete.
```

## Step 5: Verify and Manage the Application

- Backend: <http://localhost:8000/>
- UI: <http://localhost:5173/> (change with `UI_PORT=<port> ./setup.sh`)

Check status and logs:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml ps
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f app
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f model-downloader ovms
curl --noproxy '*' http://localhost:8000/api/v1/system/health
```

The Content Search health response reports ChromaDB, file ingestion/embedding
models, SQLite and (when enabled) video preprocessing/VLM readiness. HTTP 503
means the search stack is not ready yet, even if the main app's `/health` is 200.
Service startup errors are included in `docker logs smart-classroom-app`.

Stop the services:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down
kill $(cat ui/vite-dev.pid)   # stop the UI dev server
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After changing `config.yaml`, rerun `./setup.sh` so that profiles and model lists are regenerated and the stack restarts with the new configuration.

## Network Requirements

- **Proxy**: If behind a proxy, configure `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` for the shell and for Docker.
- **Model Downloads**: Stable access to `huggingface.co` is required to download pre-trained models.
