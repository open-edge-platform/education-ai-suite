    "Good morning everyone. Today we are exploring ecosystems and how energy moves through a food web.",
    "An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with each other and with their physical environment.",
    "Producers, like plants and algae, capture sunlight through photosynthesis and convert it into chemical energy.",
    "This stored energy forms the base of the food web and supports consumers such as herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores.",
    "Decomposers, including fungi and bacteria, break down dead material and recycle nutrients back into the soil.",
    "Energy transfer between trophic levels is inefficient. Typically, only about ten percent of energy moves up to the next level.",
    "Because of this energy loss, food webs have many producers, fewer primary consumers, and even fewer top predators.",
    "Let’s consider a simple pond ecosystem: phytoplankton are producers, zooplankton are primary consumers,",
    "small fish eat zooplankton, larger fish eat small fish, and birds like herons may eat the larger fish.",
    "If pollution reduces the phytoplankton, it limits energy entering the system and can collapse higher trophic levels.",
    "Biodiversity increases ecosystem stability. With more species playing similar roles, the system is more resilient to change.",
    "Disturbances like droughts or invasive species can shift the balance, but diverse ecosystems recover more quickly.",
    "Human activities such as habitat destruction and nutrient runoff can degrade ecosystems and reduce biodiversity.",
    "Restoration efforts focus on removing stressors, reintroducing native species, and allowing natural processes to resume.",
    "Now, let’s connect to cycles: water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles link ecosystems across regions and timescales.",
    "The water cycle moves water via evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff, distributing life’s most basic resource.",
    "The carbon cycle ties photosynthesis and respiration together. Plants fix carbon; consumers and decomposers return it to the atmosphere.",
    "Excess atmospheric CO2 from fossil fuels intensifies the greenhouse effect, altering temperature and precipitation patterns.",
    "The nitrogen cycle depends on specialized bacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen into forms organisms can use.",
    "Agricultural fertilizers add reactive nitrogen, which can wash into waterways and cause algal blooms.",
    "When algal blooms die, decomposition consumes oxygen, creating hypoxic zones that stress or kill aquatic life.",
    "Sustainable practices—buffer strips, wetland conservation, and precision fertilization—help protect water quality.",
    "Food webs are dynamic. Seasonal changes, migration, and life cycles cause energy pathways to shift over time.",
    "Monitoring indicators such as species richness, primary productivity, and nutrient concentrations helps assess ecosystem health.",
    "Technologies like remote sensing and environmental DNA give scientists powerful tools to track change at scale.",
    "Finally, remember that small actions scale up: reducing waste, supporting habitat projects, and informed policy choices matter.",
    "In our next session, we will analyze a case study where wetland restoration increased biodiversity and improved water quality.",
    "For now, take a moment to sketch a food web from your local area and note possible stressors and mitigation strategies."
