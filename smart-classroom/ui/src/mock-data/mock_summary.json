    "summary": "Energy flows from producers to higher trophic levels with ~10% efficiency per transfer. Biodiversity and the water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles underpin ecosystem stability. Human pressures like pollution and nutrient runoff can disrupt food webs, while restoration and sustainable practices improve resilience and water quality.",
    "key_points": [
      "Producers capture solar energy; only ~10% passes to the next level.",
      "Decomposers recycle nutrients, closing matter loops.",
      "Biodiversity increases resilience to disturbance.",
      "Biogeochemical cycles connect ecosystems across scales.",
      "CO2 emissions and nutrient runoff drive warming and algal blooms.",
      "Monitoring (richness, productivity, nutrients) tracks ecosystem health.",
      "Restoration and better land management reduce stressors."

    "actions": [
      "Sketch a local food web; identify stressors.",
      "Suggest two mitigation steps (buffers, reduced fertilizer).",
      "Track one indicator over time with your class."
